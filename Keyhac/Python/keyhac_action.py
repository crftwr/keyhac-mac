    Base class for threaded actions.

    To run a time consuming task as an output key action, you need to use threads.
    ThreadedAction helps to define threaded action classes easily.

    To define your own threaded action class, derive the ThreadedAction class
    and implement starting(), run(), and finished() methods.
    run() is executed in a thread pool for time consuming tasks.
    starting() and finished() are for light-weight tasks
